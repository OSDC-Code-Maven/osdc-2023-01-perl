        * Introducing testing, CI etc.
    * If you'd like to send me an email reply to the one I sent you. Keep the subject line. Remove the irrelevant content.
      Without this it is **very** difficult for me to associate all the emails with the different courses I teach.
    * Assignments
        * Will be in some public GitHub or GitLab repositories
        * At the end of each assignment you'll write a report - a blog post / journal entry.
        * You will add it to your personal JSON file and send a Pull-Request with the change. (We'll learn these soon)
        * First few assignments will be to my projects or your own projects. This allows for quick feedback and integration.
        * Then we'll find you open source projects maintained by other people.
    * The more you participate, the more you learn in this course.
    * The more effort you put in this course, the more you will gain.
        * Ask questions!
        * Try to help others! The more you help others the more you will learn.
    * Grades: (if relevant) are based on the work done during the course. There is no end-project or exam at the end.

* Version Control
    * Why use version control?
    * Wikipedia and the verion control there. Recommended to watch:
        * [How to edit wikipedia](https://code-maven.com/edit-wikipedia)
        * [How to edit wikipedia (in Hebrew)](https://he.code-maven.com/edit-wikipedia)
        * [Como editar una p√°gina en Wikipedia](https://es.code-maven.com/editar-wikipedia)

* [GitHub](https://github.com/): process of contributing to an Open Source project using the GitHub web site. Editing and sending a Pull-Request. Use a the `cm-demo` user to make a change in the README of this repository and then to add the json file. Show how the CI fails when we add an incorrectly formatted file.
* What is [JSON](https://www.json.org/)?

* Show the Git repository of the project and the web site generated from it.

* Show blogging platform
    * [DEV](https://dev.to/) - See [my account](https://dev.to/szabgab/)


### Assignment 1

* You will have to publish a journal of your process.
    * [DEV](https://dev.to/) - shared blogging platform. See [my account](https://dev.to/szabgab/)
* Create an account on the blogging platform you selected. (if you already have one, you can use that)
* Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) (if you already have one, use that)
* Create an account on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) (if you already have one, use that)
* Add a picture to all these accounts. It is preferably a picture of you, but it can be a drawing of you, or some other avatar you might want to use.
* Send a pull-request to the GitHub repository of the course adding a JSON file. The name of the file should be your GitHub username and it should include key-value pairs as in the example. (The `posts` will be an empty list.) Check the result of GitHub Actions.
* Join the Slack workspace (I send invitations to everyone to their email address.) and say hi.
* Write a blog post about the course. In your post link to your GitHub and GitLab accounts and to your Pull-Request. If you encountered any issue, write about that and how you solved it. If you use an avatar instead of your own picture, describe how you created the avatar.
* In the blog post tell us a bit about your background.
    * What programming language(s) you use?
    * Which interesting 3rd-party libraries do you use? You can mention big ones, but it is probably more interesting if you mention more esoteric ones.
    * Include links to the home-page of each project and the GitHub/GitLab repository of each project.
    * What would you like to accomplish in the course?
    * Which open source projects would you like to contribute to.
* Update your Pull-request adding the URL to the blog post to the `posts` field in the json file.

* There are 3 GitHub repositories with lists of GitHub organization published by [higher education institutions](https://github.com/szabgab/open-source-by-higher-education), [governments](https://github.com/szabgab/open-source-by-government), and [corporations](https://github.com/szabgab/open-source-by-corporations). Find at least 5 more organizations that share some of their code using an open source license in GitHub or GitLab. An organization can be a corporation, a university, a college, a research institute, or a government. (e.g. find a list of universities and use the search feature of GitHub to find **organizations** that belong to the institute).
